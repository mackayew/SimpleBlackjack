# SimpleBlackjack

This is a simple text-based Blackjack game I created to demonstrate my understanding of Python classes and list comprehension.
As of right now the program simply deals cards and plays Blackjack, there is no betting and no GUI, however I plan to add both of these to the program in the future.
